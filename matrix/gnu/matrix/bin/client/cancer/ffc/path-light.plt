# Code examples
# Gnuplot commands are shown using a monospace font, like this: plot sin(x). Gnu-
# plot commands can be entered at the gnuplot command prompt as shown in the text;
# the prompt itself has been suppressed to save space.
# Single command lines can be long; to make them fit on a page, I occasionally had
# to break them across multiple lines. If so, a gray arrow (âž¥) has been placed at the
# beginning of the next line, to indicate that it is the continuation of the previous one:
